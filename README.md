The file:

TorusDBN_Bivariate_Von_Mises_Sine_model

is well commented. If you understand this one. Then you will understand the rest as well

OBS!: I have commented out the check for bimodality in the bivariate von mises distribution class, this can be commented back in.
OBS!: I have commented out the check for range of skew parameters in the sine skewed bivariate von mises sine model class. This can be commented back in.
